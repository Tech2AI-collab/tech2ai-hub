You can copy–paste it directly.\n**\n[Intro – hook]\nMost people think clearing their browser history is enough to stay private on their PC.\nBut Windows 11 is quietly keeping its own diary of what you do… and it lives inside a hidden file almost nobody knows about.\nEvery app you open, every document you touch, sometimes even websites you visit – a lot of that can be logged in this one place.\nIn this video, you’ll see exactly where that secret activity log lives, how to open and read it yourself, and how to delete it and limit what Windows records going forward.![new error.png](/uploads/images/1769945935302-395359476-newerror.png)\n[Short context]\nTo be clear, this isn’t a virus or some hacker tool.\nIt’s part of Windows “activity history” – a feature that lets Windows remember what you were doing and, in some cases, sync that across devices.\nThe problem is how detailed this log can be, and the fact that it’s completely hidden from normal users.\nSo let’s go and find it.\n\n[Step 1 – Find the hidden folder]\nFirst, we’re going to open the folder where Windows stores this activity database.\nOn your keyboard, press the Windows key and the R key together.\nThat opens the Run box in the bottom corner.\nIn the Run box, type this exactly:\npercent local app data percent backslash ConnectedDevicesPlatform\nSo that is: %localappdata%\\ConnectedDevicesPlatform and then press Enter\nThis takes you into a hidden area under your user profile that Windows uses for something called the Connected Devices Platform and for activity history.\nInside this folder, you should see one or more sub folders.\nOn most systems there will be a folder that starts with the letter “L” and your username, or a long ID.\nOpen the folder that belongs to your current Windows user.\n________________________________________\n[Step 2 – Reveal the “diary” file]\nInside that folder, look for a file called:\n“ActivitiesCache dot d b”.\nThis is the key file.\n“ActivitiesCache dot d b” is a SQLite database file where Windows stores a timeline of your activity for this account.\nNext to it, you might also see “ActivitiesCache dot d b dash s h m” and “ActivitiesCache dot d b dash w a l”.\nThose are side files that the database engine uses for caching and logging.\nRight now, you can’t just double click this file and read it in Notepad.\nWe need a small tool to look inside.\n________________________________________\n[Step 3 – Install DB Browser for SQLite]\n\nTo open this database, we’ll use a free program called <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-in/lp/dt/supportassist-for-home-pcs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">“DB Browser for SQLite”</a>.\n\nIt’s an open source, visual tool that lets you browse and search SQLite databases without writing any code.sqlitebrowser+1\nOpen your web browser and search for: “DB Browser for SQLite official”.\nClick the official sqlitebrowser dot org website.\nOn the downloads page, choose the Windows installer that matches your system, download it, and run the installer.\nYou can just accept the default options by clicking Next until it finishes.\nOnce it’s installed, we’re ready to actually open the activity log.![pdf error show.png](/uploads/images/1769945959122-57570051-pdferrorshow.png)\n________________________________________\n[Step 4 – Open and read the activity log]\nGo back to File Explorer where you can see “ActivitiesCache dot d b”.\nRight click on “ActivitiesCache dot d b”.\nChoose “Open with”, and then select “DB Browser for SQLite”.\nIf you don’t see it in the list, click “Choose another app” and browse to the program manually.carpentry.\nWhen DB Browser opens, you’ll see a few tabs at the top.\nClick on the tab that says “Browse Data”.\nThere’s a dropdown for choosing a table.\nSelect the main table – on many systems it will be called “Activity” or “Activities”, or something similar.\nNow you should see rows of data appear in a grid.\n\nI prefer not to show my activities. Therefore I blur it here.\nEach row represents some kind of activity on your PC:\n•\tOne column will contain timestamps, which are the dates and times when things happened.\n•\tAnother column will contain app identifiers or names for the programs you used, like your browser or Office apps.\n•\tOther columns may contain file paths and file names for documents you opened.\n•\tIn some cases, you may also see website URLs or links related to that activity.If you scroll through this table, you are essentially looking at a raw, machine readable diary of how this Windows account has been used.\nEven if you have cleared your browser history, this separate Windows database can still show when certain apps or documents were opened, and when specific activities took place.\nFor the video, you can slowly scroll and zoom in on a few safe examples:\na test PDF, a sample folder path, or a harmless website.\nAvoid exposing anything truly sensitive here.\n________________________________________\n[Step 5 – Delete the log file]\nIf you’re not comfortable leaving this log on your machine, you can delete it.\nClose DB Browser for SQLite so the file isn’t in use.\nGo back to File Explorer in the same folder.\nSelect “ActivitiesCache dot d b”.\nIf you see “ActivitiesCache dot d b dash s h m” and “ActivitiesCache dot d b dash w a l”, select those as well.\nRight click and choose Delete, or press the Delete key.\nThen go to your Recycle Bin and empty it to remove the files completely.\nWindows will recreate a fresh version of this database over time as it needs it, but the history you just saw will be wiped.\n________________________________________\nStep 6 – Clear search history and reduce what’s stored]\nNext, let’s clean up some of the history Windows uses for search and suggestions.\nClick the Start button and open Settings.\nIn the left sidebar, click on Privacy & security.\nUnder Windows permissions, choose Search.\nHere you’ll see an option called Search history on this device.\nIf you don’t want Windows Search to keep a history of what you’ve searched for, turn this off.\nThen click Clear device search history to wipe what’s already saved.\nOn some older Windows 11 builds there used to be a separate “Activity history” page here, with a checkbox for “Store my activity history on this device”.\nOn the latest Windows 11 versions, including 25H2, Microsoft has removed or hidden that page for many users, so you may not see it at all.\nThat’s why in this video the focus is on the hidden ActivitiesCache.db file we just wiped, plus the search history and recent item settings you can still control in the normal interface.\n________________________________________\n[Optional extra – reduce recent items surfacing]\nIf you want to go a bit further in hiding your recent activity from the interface, you can also adjust one more area.\nIn Settings, go to “Personalization”, then click “Start.”\nHere, you can turn off options like:\n“Show recently added apps” and\n“Show recently opened items in Start, Jump Lists, and File Explorer”.\nThis doesn’t remove all logging under the hood, but it does stop Windows from constantly surfacing your recent apps and files everywhere in the Start menu and taskbar.\n\n[Safety and expectations]\nBefore wrapping up, it’s important to set expectations.\nThis activity database and these settings are part of Windows itself.\nThey’re not malware, and they are also used for legitimate features like “continue where you left off” and multi device experiences.\nClearing and disabling them can slightly change how “recent files” and some timeline style features behave, especially if you use multiple devices with the same account.\nAnd even after doing all this, Windows will still keep some types of logs elsewhere, for example in event logs used for troubleshooting, or in basic diagnostic telemetry.\n Think of what you’ve done here as removing a very detailed, easy to read diary of your activity, not erasing every trace that anything ever happened.\n________________________________________\n[Outro and call to action]\nNow you know where Windows 11 hides one of its most detailed activity logs, how to open it with a free tool, and how to wipe it and reduce what gets stored.\nIf you try this on your own PC, pause for a moment and actually look at what’s inside that database.\nLet me know in the comments: what was the most surprising thing you found in your own activity log?\nIf you want to go even further, into disabling telemetry, ads, and other tracking features across Windows 11, keep an eye out for a full Windows privacy hardening video that will be released soon.\nThanks for watching, and if this helped you understand what your system is really recording, consider subscribing for more practical privacy and security guides.\n\n",
